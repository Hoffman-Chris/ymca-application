A graphical user interface must be developed for this software. The interface must consist of multiple screens for different tasks. For example, there should be a welcome screen to start with which displays the various functionalities of the software. If one chooses to login or register to the system, there must be a separate window/screen that displays the requested information. The number of screens, the screen layout, the type of information to be displayed etc. all depend on your design.

You can associate a database with your product, if you wish; however, it is not required.
